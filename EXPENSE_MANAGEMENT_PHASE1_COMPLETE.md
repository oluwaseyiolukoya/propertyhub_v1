## 🗄️ Database Schema

### New `expenses` Table

model expenses {
  id              String     @id
  propertyId      String
  unitId          String?
  category        String
  description     String
  amount          Float
  currency        String     @default("NGN")
  date            DateTime   @default(now())
  dueDate         DateTime?
  status          String     @default("pending")
  paidDate        DateTime?
  paymentMethod   String?
  recordedBy      String
  recordedByRole  String
  receipt         String?
  notes           String?
  requiresApproval Boolean   @default(false)
  approvedBy      String?
  approvedAt      DateTime?
  createdAt       DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime   @updatedAt
  
  property        properties @relation(fields: [propertyId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  unit            units?     @relation(fields: [unitId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  recorder        users      @relation("RecordedExpenses", fields: [recordedBy], references: [id])
  approver        users?     @relation("ApprovedExpenses", fields: [approvedBy], references: [id])
  
  @@index([propertyId])
  @@index([date])
  @@index([category])
  @@index([status])
}
```

| `GET` | `/` | Get all expenses (filtered by user's properties) | Owner/Manager |
| `GET` | `/:id` | Get single expense details | Owner/Manager |

### Query Parameters (for GET `/`):

```typescript
{
  propertyId?: string;
  category?: string;
  status?: string;
  startDate?: string; // ISO date
  endDate?: string;   // ISO date
}
```

### Example API Usage:

#### Create Expense
```bash
POST /api/expenses
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "propertyId": "uuid",
  "unitId": "uuid",  // optional
  "category": "maintenance",
  "description": "Plumbing repair in Unit 3A",
  "amount": 15000,
  "currency": "NGN",
  "date": "2025-10-27",
  "status": "paid",
  "paymentMethod": "bank_transfer",
  "notes": "Emergency repair"
}
```

#### Get Expense Statistics
```bash
GET /api/expenses/stats/overview?propertyId=uuid&startDate=2025-10-01&endDate=2025-10-31
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response:
{
  "totalAmount": 150000,
  "totalCount": 12,
  "byCategory": [
    { "category": "maintenance", "_sum": { "amount": 75000 }, "_count": 5 },
    { "category": "utilities", "_sum": { "amount": 45000 }, "_count": 4 }
  ],
  "byStatus": [
    { "status": "paid", "_sum": { "amount": 120000 }, "_count": 9 },
    { "status": "pending", "_sum": { "amount": 30000 }, "_count": 3 }
  ]
}
```

## 📂 Frontend API Client

### File: `src/lib/api/expenses.ts`

Provides TypeScript interfaces and functions for all expense operations:

```typescript
// Available functions
import {
  getExpenses,
  getExpense,
  createExpense,
  updateExpense,
  deleteExpense,
  getExpenseStats,
  approveExpense
} from '../lib/api/expenses';

// Available constants
import {
  EXPENSE_CATEGORIES,
  EXPENSE_STATUSES,
  PAYMENT_METHODS
} from '../lib/api/expenses';
```

### Expense Categories:
- Maintenance & Repairs
- Utilities
- Insurance
- Property Tax
- Management Fee
- Leasing Fee
- Cleaning
- Landscaping
- Security
- Waste Management
- Legal Fees
- Accounting
- Advertising & Marketing
- Other

---

## 💰 Financial Calculations Update

### Before (Estimated):
```typescript
const estimatedExpenses = totalRevenue * 0.3; // 30% estimate
```

### After (Real Data):
```typescript
const actualExpenses = await prisma.expenses.aggregate({
  where: {
    propertyId: { in: propertyIds },
    status: { in: ['paid', 'pending'] }
  },
  _sum: { amount: true }
});

// Use actual expenses if available, otherwise fall back to estimate
const estimatedExpenses = actualExpenses._sum.amount || (totalRevenue * 0.3);
```

### Impact:
- **Net Operating Income (NOI)** now uses real expense data
- **Cap Rate** calculations are more accurate
- **Operating Margin** reflects actual performance
- Still falls back to 30% estimate if no expenses recorded

---

## 🔐 Authorization & Access Control

### Owners Can:
- ✅ Create expenses for their properties
- ✅ View all expenses for their properties
- ✅ Edit any expense for their properties
- ✅ Delete expenses

### Managers Can:
- ✅ Create expenses for properties they manage (requires approval)
