## Troubleshooting Checklist

If something goes wrong:

### Build Fails
- [ ] Check build logs in App Platform
- [ ] Verify all dependencies in package.json
- [ ] Test build locally: `npm run build`
- [ ] Check Node.js version compatibility

### Backend Won't Start
- [ ] Check runtime logs
- [ ] Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
- [ ] Check all required environment variables are set
- [ ] Verify health check endpoint works
- [ ] Check port is set to 5000

### Database Connection Fails
- [ ] Verify DATABASE_URL format
- [ ] Check database is running
- [ ] Verify trusted sources include App Platform
- [ ] Check connection limit in DATABASE_URL

### Frontend Can't Reach Backend
- [ ] Verify VITE_API_URL is correct
- [ ] Check CORS settings in backend
- [ ] Verify FRONTEND_URL in backend matches frontend domain
- [ ] Check network tab for actual error

### 502 Bad Gateway
- [ ] Check backend is running
- [ ] Verify health check passes
- [ ] Check backend logs for errors
- [ ] Verify port configuration

## Cost Optimization

### Monthly Review
- [ ] Review resource usage
- [ ] Downsize unused resources
- [ ] Check bandwidth usage
- [ ] Review database storage
- [ ] Optimize queries for efficiency
- [ ] Consider reserved instances for savings

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- [ ] Check error logs
- [ ] Monitor uptime
- [ ] Verify backups completed

### Weekly
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Check security logs
- [ ] Update dependencies (if needed)
- [ ] Review user feedback

### Monthly
- [ ] Database maintenance (VACUUM, ANALYZE)
- [ ] Review and rotate logs
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Cost review
- [ ] Backup restore test
