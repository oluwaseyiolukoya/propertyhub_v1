# Directory Organization - Complete

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Reorganized the entire project directory structure following industry best practices for scalability, maintainability, and developer experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Organization

Created a comprehensive documentation hierarchy:

```
docs/
├── README.md              # Documentation index
├── setup/                 # Setup & deployment guides
├── guides/                # How-to guides
├── features/              # Feature documentation
├── architecture/          # Architecture docs
├── reports/               # Status reports
└── archive/               # Historical docs & fixes
```

**Moved Files**:
- 50+ markdown files organized from root into appropriate subdirectories
- Feature docs → `docs/features/`
- Setup guides → `docs/setup/`
- Bug fixes → `docs/archive/`
- Status reports → `docs/reports/`

### 2. Backend Scaffolding

Added recommended directory structure for future refactoring:

```
backend/src/
├── services/              # Business logic layer
├── controllers/           # HTTP request handlers
└── repositories/          # Data access layer
```

Each directory includes a README with:
- Purpose and responsibilities
- Usage examples
- Migration guidelines

### 3. Frontend Scaffolding

Added recommended directory structure for feature-based organization:

```
src/
├── features/              # Feature modules
│   ├── payments/
│   ├── tenants/
│   └── properties/
└── types/                 # Shared TypeScript types
```

Each directory includes a README with:
- Organization patterns
- Best practices
- Example structure

### 4. Logs Management

- Created `logs/` directory
- Moved `server-dev.log` to `logs/`
- Added `logs/` to `.gitignore`

### 5. Configuration Files

Added standard configuration files:

**`.editorconfig`**:
- Consistent code formatting across editors
- 2-space indentation for JS/TS/JSON
- LF line endings
- UTF-8 encoding

**`.vscode/settings.json`**:
- Format on save
- ESLint auto-fix
- Prettier as default formatter
- TypeScript workspace SDK
- Exclude patterns for search/watch

**`.vscode/extensions.json`**:
- Recommended VS Code extensions
- Prettier, ESLint, Prisma, Tailwind CSS

**`.gitignore`** (updated):
- Added `logs/` directory
- Standardized patterns
- Added build artifacts

### 6. Project Documentation

Created comprehensive project documentation:

**`README.md`** (root):
- Quick start guide
- Tech stack overview
- Key features
- Project structure
- Development commands
- Links to detailed docs

**`backend/README.md`**:
- Backend-specific setup
- Architecture guidelines
- Prisma commands
- API documentation links
- Deployment checklist

**`DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`**:
- Complete directory tree
- Directory conventions
- Migration strategy
- Naming conventions
- Best practices

**`CONTRIBUTING.md`**:
- Development workflow
- Coding standards
- Architecture guidelines
- Documentation requirements
- Testing guidelines
- Code review process
- Common pitfalls

### Future (Gradual Refactoring)

**Backend**:
1. Extract payment logic to services
2. Create payment repository
3. Add payment controller
4. Repeat for other modules

**Frontend**:
1. Extract shared types to `src/types/`
2. Group payment components in `src/features/payments/`
3. Create custom hooks per feature
4. Repeat for other features

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Read through `docs/README.md`
   - Familiarize with new structure
   - Update any bookmarks

2. **Configure IDE**
   - Install recommended VS Code extensions
   - Verify settings are applied
   - Test format on save

3. **Plan Refactoring**
   - Choose first module to refactor (e.g., payments)
   - Follow migration guide in `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`
   - Refactor incrementally

4. **Update Team**
   - Share `CONTRIBUTING.md` with team
   - Document any project-specific conventions
   - Establish code review standards

## Verification

To verify the organization:

```bash
# Check documentation structure
ls -R docs/

# Verify no markdown files in root (except README, etc.)
ls -1 *.md

# Check scaffolding directories exist
ls -d backend/src/{services,controllers,repositories}
ls -d src/{features,types}

# Verify logs directory
ls logs/

# Check VS Code config
ls .vscode/
```

## Conclusion

The project directory is now organized following industry best practices. The structure supports:
- Easy navigation and discovery
- Gradual refactoring without breaking changes
- Clear separation of concerns
- Professional development workflow
- Scalable architecture

All changes are non-breaking and existing code continues to work. The scaffolded directories provide a clear path for future improvements.
