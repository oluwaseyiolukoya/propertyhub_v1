## Rationale for Change

### Why "Key Management" instead of "Access Control"?

1. **Clarity**: "Key Management" is more descriptive of what the page actually does - managing physical keys
2. **User-Friendly**: Non-technical users understand "Key Management" better than "Access Control"
3. **Accurate**: The page focuses on key inventory, issuance, returns, and deposits - core key management functions
4. **Industry Standard**: Property management industry commonly uses "Key Management" terminology
5. **Avoiding Confusion**: "Access Control" could be confused with digital access systems or permissions

### What the Page Actually Does
- Manages physical key inventory
- Tracks key issuance to tenants/managers
- Records key returns and conditions
- Monitors security deposits for keys
- Maintains custody chain documentation
- Handles lost/damaged key reports

## Visual Changes

### Owner Dashboard
**Before:**
- Sidebar: "Access Control"
- Quick Access Button: "Access Control"
- Page Header: "Key Management & Access Control"

**After:**
- Sidebar: "Key Management" ✅
- Quick Access Button: "Key Management" ✅
- Page Header: "Key Management" ✅

### Manager Dashboard
**Before:**
- Sidebar: "Access Control"
- Page Header: "Key Management & Access Control"

**After:**
- Sidebar: "Key Management" ✅
- Page Header: "Key Management" ✅

## User Experience Impact

### Benefits:
✅ **Clearer Navigation**: Users immediately understand this section manages physical keys  
✅ **Reduced Confusion**: No longer mistaken for digital access/permissions management  
✅ **Professional**: Aligns with industry terminology  
✅ **Consistent**: All references now use the same terminology  
✅ **Intuitive**: New users can find key-related features easily  

### No Breaking Changes:
- Internal route key remains `'access'` for backward compatibility
- No database changes required
- No API endpoint changes needed
- Existing functionality unchanged

## Testing Checklist
✅ Owner dashboard sidebar displays "Key Management"  
✅ Owner dashboard quick access button shows "Key Management"  
✅ Manager dashboard sidebar displays "Key Management"  
✅ Page header shows "Key Management"  
✅ Navigation still works correctly (internal key unchanged)  
✅ No linter errors  
✅ No console errors  

## Additional Notes

- The Shield icon remains unchanged (still appropriate for key management)
- The internal routing key `'access'` was intentionally kept to avoid breaking localStorage states
- All functionality remains exactly the same - this is purely a labeling change
- The subtitle "Track physical keys, custody chain, and compliance documentation" helps clarify the purpose
