## Implementation Details

### Tooltip Design
- **Icon**: Small info icon (3.5x3.5 size)
- **Color**: Muted foreground color to be subtle
- **Cursor**: Help cursor on hover
- **Positioning**: Positioned immediately after the card title
- **Max Width**: `max-w-xs` to prevent overly wide tooltips

### Code Structure
```tsx
<TooltipProvider>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-5 gap-4">
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <CardTitle>Total Keys</CardTitle>
          <Tooltip>
            <TooltipTrigger asChild>
              <Info className="h-3.5 w-3.5 text-muted-foreground cursor-help" />
            </TooltipTrigger>
            <TooltipContent>
              <p className="max-w-xs">[Explanation text]</p>
            </TooltipContent>
          </Tooltip>
        </div>
        {/* ... rest of card */}
      </CardHeader>
    </Card>
    {/* ... other cards */}
  </div>
</TooltipProvider>
```

### User Experience
