# Expense Visibility & Property Totals Update

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Two major updates have been implemented for the Expense Management system:

1. **Changed Default Visibility** - Expenses are now hidden from managers by default
2. **Property Expense Totals** - Owners can now see total expenses for each property

---

## 🔒 1. Default Visibility Changed to Hidden

### **Previous Behavior:**
- ❌ All expenses visible to managers by default
- Required owner to manually hide each expense

### **New Behavior:**
- ✅ All expenses **hidden from managers by default**
- Owner must explicitly make expenses visible to managers
- Better privacy and control for sensitive financial data

---

## 📊 2. Property Expense Totals

### **What's New:**
Owners can now see a breakdown of total expenses for each property, including:
- Property name
- Number of expenses
- Total amount in the property's currency
- Visual cards with hover effects

### **Where to Find:**
Navigate to **Expenses** page → Scroll to **"Expenses by Property"** section (appears after main stats cards)

---

## 🎯 Updated Visibility Rules

| Expense Type | Default Visibility | Visible to Owner | Visible to Manager | Can Toggle |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Owner-Created** | ❌ Hidden | ✅ Always | ❌ Only if owner allows | ✅ Yes (Owner) |
| **Manager-Created** | ✅ Visible | ✅ Always | ✅ Always | ❌ No |

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **1. Database Schema:**
```prisma
model expenses {
  // ... other fields ...
  visibleToManager Boolean @default(false)  // Changed from true to false
  
  @@index([visibleToManager])
}
```

### **2. Backend API:**

#### Stats Endpoint Enhancement:
```typescript
GET /api/expenses/stats/overview

// Now returns:
{
  totalAmount: number,
  totalCount: number,
  byCategory: [...],
  byStatus: [...],
  byProperty: [  // NEW!
    {
      propertyId: string,
      propertyName: string,
      currency: string,
      totalAmount: number,
      count: number
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Create Expense:
```typescript
POST /api/expenses
{
  // ... other fields ...
  visibleToManager: false  // Default false
}
```

### **3. Frontend Updates:**

#### New UI Component:
- **Expenses by Property** card section
- Shows only for owners
- Displays property-wise expense breakdown
- Uses property's native currency for display

#### Updated Form Defaults:
```typescript
expenseForm: {
  // ... other fields ...
  visibleToManager: false  // Changed from true to false
}
```

## 📋 Migration Notes

### **Existing Data:**
- ✅ Database schema updated with `default(false)`
- ✅ All **NEW** expenses will be hidden by default
- ⚠️ **EXISTING** expenses retain their current `visibleToManager` value

### **If You Want to Update Existing Expenses:**
To hide all existing owner expenses from managers, run this SQL:

```sql
UPDATE expenses 
SET "visibleToManager" = false 
WHERE "recordedByRole" ILIKE '%owner%';
```

To keep existing expenses visible (no action needed):
- Existing expenses maintain their current visibility
- Only new expenses follow the new default (hidden)
