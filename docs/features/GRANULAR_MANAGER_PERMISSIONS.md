# Granular Manager Permissions Control

## Overview
Updated the Manager Permissions section in the Owner Dashboard Settings to provide granular control over what managers can do with checkboxes and a dedicated Save button.

## Implementation Details

### Location
**Owner Dashboard → Settings → Security Tab → Manager Permissions**

### Features

#### 1. Units Management
Control what managers can do with units:
- ✅ **View Units** - Managers can see unit information
- ✅ **Create Units** - Managers can add new units (default: ON)
- ✅ **Edit Units** - Managers can modify unit details (default: ON)
- ❌ **Delete Units** - Managers can remove units (default: OFF)

#### 2. Properties Management
Control what managers can do with properties:
- ✅ **View Properties** - Managers can see property information (default: ON)
- ❌ **Edit Properties** - Managers can modify property details (default: OFF)

#### 3. Tenants Management
Control what managers can do with tenants:
- ✅ **View Tenants** - Managers can see tenant information (default: ON)
- ✅ **Add Tenants** - Managers can create new tenants (default: ON)
- ✅ **Edit Tenants** - Managers can modify tenant details (default: ON)
- ❌ **Remove Tenants** - Managers can delete tenants (default: OFF)

#### 4. Financial Access
Control financial data visibility:
- ✅ **View Reports** - Managers can view financial reports (default: ON)

### UI Layout
- Each permission category (Units, Properties, Tenants, Financial) is in its own bordered section
- Checkboxes are organized in a responsive grid (2 columns on mobile, 4 columns on desktop)
- Clear section titles and descriptions
- Blue info box with note about per-manager overrides
- **Save Permissions** button with Save icon at the bottom right

### Security Settings State
```typescript
{
  // Units permissions
  managerCanViewUnits: true,
  managerCanCreateUnits: true,
  managerCanEditUnits: true,
  managerCanDeleteUnits: false,
  
  // Properties permissions
  managerCanViewProperties: true,
  managerCanEditProperty: false,
  
  // Tenants permissions
  managerCanViewTenants: true,
  managerCanCreateTenants: true,
  managerCanEditTenants: true,
  managerCanDeleteTenants: false,
  
  // Financial permissions
  managerCanViewFinancials: true
}
```

### User Experience
1. Owner navigates to Settings → Security
2. Scrolls to "Manager Permissions" section
3. Sees 4 categorized permission groups
4. Checks/unchecks permissions using checkboxes
5. Clicks "Save Permissions" button to apply changes
6. Receives success toast notification

### Default Permissions (Recommended for Safety)
- **View permissions**: Enabled (managers should see what they manage)
- **Create permissions**: Enabled for units and tenants (core manager tasks)
- **Edit permissions**: Enabled for units and tenants, disabled for properties
- **Delete permissions**: Disabled (requires owner approval)
- **Financial access**: Enabled (managers need to see reports)

### Benefits
1. **Granular Control**: Separate view, create, edit, and delete permissions
2. **Category Organization**: Grouped by resource type (Units, Properties, Tenants, Financial)
3. **Visual Clarity**: Checkbox-based UI is intuitive and familiar
4. **Explicit Save**: Changes aren't applied until "Save Permissions" is clicked
5. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile and desktop screens
6. **Safety First**: Destructive actions (delete) default to OFF

### Files Modified
- `src/components/PropertyOwnerSettings.tsx`
  - Added Checkbox component import
  - Expanded securitySettings state with 11 granular permissions
  - Replaced toggle switches with checkbox-based permission groups
  - Added "Save Permissions" button with toast notification

### Integration with Property Management
The `managerCanCreateUnits` permission controls visibility of the "Add Unit" button in:
- **Property Manager Dashboard → Properties → Units Tab**

When enabled, managers see the "Add Unit" button and can create units through a comprehensive form dialog.

### Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Backend API Integration**: Connect Save button to API endpoint to persist permissions
2. **Per-Manager Overrides**: Allow setting custom permissions for individual managers
3. **Role-Based Templates**: Create permission templates (e.g., "Full Access", "Read Only", "Limited")
4. **Permission History**: Track who changed what permissions and when
5. **Bulk Permission Management**: Apply permissions to multiple managers at once

### Testing Checklist
- ✅ All checkboxes toggle correctly
- ✅ State updates when checkboxes are clicked
- ✅ Save button shows success toast
- ✅ UI is responsive on mobile and desktop
- ✅ Labels are clickable and match checkboxes
- ✅ Default values are appropriate for security
- ⏳ Backend integration (pending)
- ⏳ Per-manager overrides (pending)

## Notes
- This is the default permission template applied to all managers
- Individual manager permissions can still be overridden in the Property Manager Management page
- Changes are saved when "Save Permissions" button is clicked
- Success feedback is provided via toast notification
