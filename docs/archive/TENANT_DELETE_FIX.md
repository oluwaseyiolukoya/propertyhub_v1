# Tenant Delete Feature - Fixed! ✅

## Issue Reported
When deleting a tenant from the Tenant Management page:
- ✅ Success notification appeared
- ❌ Tenant was still visible in the list
- ❌ Tenant was not actually deleted from the database

## Root Cause
The "Delete Tenant" button was calling `terminateLease()` which only:
- Changed the lease status to 'terminated'
- Made the unit vacant
- **Did NOT delete the tenant user from the database**

The tenant user remained in the database and continued to show in the tenant list.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Backend: New Delete Endpoint** ✅
**File**: `backend/src/routes/tenant.ts`

Added `DELETE /api/tenant/:id` endpoint that:
- ✅ Verifies user permissions (owner/manager/admin)
- ✅ Checks if user has access to the tenant
- ✅ Terminates all active leases for the tenant
- ✅ Updates all units to 'vacant' status
- ✅ Logs the deletion activity
- ✅ **Deletes the tenant user from the database**

```typescript
router.delete('/:id', async (req: AuthRequest, res: Response) => {
  // 1. Verify permissions
  // 2. Find tenant with leases
  // 3. Terminate all active leases
  // 4. Free up all units
  // 5. Log activity
  // 6. Delete tenant user
  // 7. Return success
});
```

### 2. **Frontend: API Function** ✅
**File**: `src/lib/api/tenant.ts`

Added `deleteTenant()` function:
```typescript
export const deleteTenant = async (tenantId: string) => {
  return apiClient.delete<{
    message: string;
    tenantEmail: string;
    tenantName: string;
  }>(`${API_ENDPOINTS.TENANT.BASE}/${tenantId}`);
};
```

### 3. **Frontend: Updated Component** ✅
**File**: `src/components/TenantManagement.tsx`

Updated `handleDeleteTenant()` to:
- Import `deleteTenant` from tenant API
- Call the new delete endpoint instead of `terminateLease`
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Refresh the tenant list after successful deletion

**Before:**
```typescript
const handleDeleteTenant = async () => {
  // Only terminated the lease
  await terminateLease(tenantToDelete.leaseId, 'Tenant deleted by owner');
  // Tenant user still existed in database!
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const handleDeleteTenant = async () => {
  // Actually deletes the tenant user
  const response = await deleteTenant(tenantToDelete.id);
  // Tenant is completely removed from database
}
```

## What Happens Now

When you click "Delete Tenant":

1. **Frontend**: 
   - Shows confirmation dialog
   - User confirms deletion
   - Calls `deleteTenant(tenantId)`

2. **Backend**:
   - Verifies your permissions
   - Finds all tenant's leases
   - Sets all units to 'vacant'
   - **Deletes all leases** (to avoid foreign key constraints)
   - **Deletes tenant's activity logs** (to avoid foreign key constraints)
   - Logs the deletion action
   - **Deletes tenant from `users` table**

3. **Result**:
   - ✅ Tenant user is removed from database
   - ✅ All leases are deleted (not just terminated)
   - ✅ Units become available
   - ✅ Deletion is logged
   - ✅ Tenant disappears from list

## Testing

### To Test the Fix:
1. **Go to**: Owner Dashboard → Tenant Management
2. **Find a tenant** you want to delete
3. **Click the red trash icon** (🗑️)
4. **Confirm deletion** in the dialog
5. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Success notification appears
   - ✅ Tenant disappears from the list
   - ✅ Unit shows as "vacant" in Units page
   - ✅ If you refresh the page, tenant is still gone

### Expected Console Logs:
```
🗑️  Deleting tenant: <tenant-id>
🗑️  Delete tenant request - User role: owner, Tenant ID: <tenant-id>
✅ Tenant deleted: <tenant-email>
✅ Tenant deleted successfully: { message: "...", tenantEmail: "...", ... }
```

## Security & Permissions

The delete endpoint enforces strict access control:
- ✅ **Super Admins**: Can delete any tenant
- ✅ **Property Owners**: Can delete tenants in their properties
- ✅ **Property Managers**: Can delete tenants in properties they manage
- ❌ **Tenants**: Cannot delete themselves or others
- ❌ **Unauthorized users**: Get 403 Forbidden error

## Database Impact

### Before Deletion:
```
users table: tenant record exists
leases table: lease(s) exist
units table: unit(s) with status='occupied'
activity_logs table: logs with tenant's userId
```

### After Deletion:
```
users table: tenant record DELETED ✅
leases table: tenant's lease(s) DELETED ✅
units table: unit(s) with status='vacant'
activity_logs table: tenant's logs DELETED, deletion logged with owner's userId
```

## ⚠️ Important Note About Foreign Keys

The Prisma schema doesn't have `onDelete: Cascade` for the `leases.users` relationship:
```prisma
leases {
  users users @relation(fields: [tenantId], references: [id])
  // ❌ No onDelete: Cascade
}
```

This means PostgreSQL prevents deleting a user who has leases. Our solution:
1. **Delete all leases first** (removes the foreign key constraint)
2. **Delete activity logs** (removes any references)
3. **Then delete the tenant user** (now safe to delete)

## Related Files Modified

### Backend
- ✅ `backend/src/routes/tenant.ts` - Added DELETE endpoint

### Frontend
- ✅ `src/lib/api/tenant.ts` - Added deleteTenant function
- ✅ `src/components/TenantManagement.tsx` - Updated delete handler

## Manual Deletion (No Cascade)

Since the Prisma schema doesn't have `onDelete: Cascade` for `leases.users`, we manually handle deletions:
- **Manually deleted by our code**:
  - ✅ `leases` - Deleted completely (not preserved)
  - ✅ `activity_logs` - Tenant's logs deleted
- **Automatically deleted by Prisma** (has `onDelete: Cascade`):
  - ✅ `customer_users` - Deleted automatically if any exist

## Notes

- **Lease History**: Leases ARE deleted (not preserved). This is necessary due to foreign key constraints. If you need to preserve lease history, consider updating the Prisma schema to add `onDelete: Cascade`.
- **Audit Trail**: The tenant's own activity logs are deleted, but a final deletion log is created with the owner/admin as the actor.
- **Units**: Units are freed up and become available for new tenants.
- **Irreversible**: Tenant deletion cannot be undone. The user, their leases, and their activity logs are permanently removed.

## ⚠️ 500 Error Fix (Foreign Key Constraints)

**Issue**: When trying to delete a tenant, you got a 500 Internal Server Error because PostgreSQL prevented the deletion due to foreign key constraints.

**Solution**: The backend now:
1. Deletes all leases first (removes FK constraint)
2. Deletes activity logs (removes FK references)
3. Then safely deletes the tenant user

This approach handles the missing `onDelete: Cascade` in the schema without requiring a database migration.

- [x] Units become available
