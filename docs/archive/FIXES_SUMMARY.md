## Fix #1: Delete Customer Error ‚úÖ

### Problem:
Customer deletion was showing "Failed to delete customer" error, even though the customer was actually being deleted from the database. This was confusing for users.

### Root Cause:
Activity log was being created **after** deleting the customer, which caused a foreign key constraint error because the user references were already deleted.

### Solution:
Reordered operations in `/backend/src/routes/customers.ts`:
1. Create activity log **before** deletion (while user references still exist)
2. Wrap activity log in try-catch (continue even if logging fails)
3. Then delete customer (cascade deletes all related records)

### Files Changed:
- `/backend/src/routes/customers.ts`

### Status: üéâ **FIXED**

## Fix #2: Subscription Plan Not Saving ‚úÖ

### Problem:
When adding a new customer in the Admin Dashboard, the selected subscription plan was not being saved to the database. The `planId` field remained null.

### Root Cause:
1. Subscription plans didn't exist in the database (seed data not run)
2. No error handling when plan lookup failed
3. Plan lookup was failing silently

### Solution:

#### 1. Added Prisma Seed Configuration

**File:** `/backend/package.json`

Added:
```json
"prisma": {
  "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
}
```

#### 2. Ran Seed Command

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma db seed
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Created Super Admin
- ‚úÖ Created 3 subscription plans (Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
- ‚úÖ Created sample customer
- ‚úÖ Created roles
- ‚úÖ Created system settings

#### 3. Added Debug Logging & Error Handling

**File:** `/backend/src/routes/customers.ts`

Added:
- Console logs for plan lookup process
- Error messages if plan not found
- Validation that plan exists before creating customer

```typescript
if (planName && !planId) {
  console.log('Looking up plan by name:', planName);
  plan = await prisma.plan.findFirst({ where: { name: planName } });
  if (plan) {
    console.log('Found plan:', plan.id, plan.name);
    finalPlanId = plan.id;
  } else {
    console.log('Plan not found with name:', planName);
    return res.status(400).json({ 
      error: `Plan "${planName}" not found. Please select a valid subscription plan.` 
    });
  }
}
console.log('Final planId:', finalPlanId);
```

### Plans Now in Database:

| Plan Name    | Monthly Price | Property Limit | User Limit | Storage  |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| Starter      | ‚Ç¶500/mo      | 5              | 3          | 1GB      |
| Professional | ‚Ç¶1,200/mo    | 20             | 10         | 5GB      |
| Enterprise   | ‚Ç¶2,500/mo    | 100            | 50         | 20GB     |

### Files Changed:
- `/backend/package.json` - Added prisma seed configuration
- `/backend/src/routes/customers.ts` - Added debug logging, error handling, and users relation to customer fetch

### Status: üéâ **FIXED**

### Important Notes:
- **Plan names ARE showing** in the frontend customer list (Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Customers ‚Üí Plan column)
- **In Prisma Studio**, you see the `planId` UUID - this is CORRECT (it's a foreign key)
- **To see plan names in Prisma Studio**: Click on the UUID link, or view the plans table
- **Database structure**: customers.planId ‚Üí plans.id (relation provides the name)

   ```
8. **‚úÖ Verify in Prisma Studio:**
   - Open http://localhost:5555
   - Go to Customer table
   - Find newly created customer
   - Check `planId` column (should NOT be null)

## Backend Logs to Watch For

### Successful Customer Creation:

```
Looking up plan by name: Professional
Found plan: clh...abc Professional
Final planId: clh...abc
POST /api/customers 201 - 150ms
```

### Successful Customer Deletion:

```
DELETE /api/customers/clh...xyz 200 - 25ms
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Backend not showing logs

npm run dev
```

### Issue: Plans still not showing

ps aux | grep postgres

# Check DATABASE_URL
cat backend/.env | grep DATABASE_URL
```

**Solution:** Restart Prisma Studio:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma studio
