# Tenant Password Reset - Fix Applied

## Problem
When trying to reset a tenant's password, the system was returning:
- **403 Forbidden Error**: "Access denied. Only property owners can reset tenant passwords."
- **Generated password not visible**: Because the request failed before the password could be generated.

## Root Cause
The backend authorization check was too restrictive. It only checked for:
- `role === 'property_owner'`
- `role === 'admin'`

However, in the system, property owners can have multiple role variations:
- `'owner'`
- `'property owner'`
- `'property_owner'`

## Fix Applied

### Backend Changes (`backend/src/routes/tenant.ts`)
Updated the authorization check to accept all role variations:

```typescript
const isAdmin = role === 'admin' || role === 'super_admin';
const isOwner = role === 'owner' || role === 'property owner' || role === 'property_owner';
const isManager = role === 'property_manager' || role === 'manager';

if (!isAdmin && !isOwner && !isManager) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied...' });
}
```

### Frontend Changes (`src/components/TenantManagement.tsx`)
Added comprehensive logging to help debug issues:
- Logs when password reset is initiated
- Logs the API response
- Logs success/failure status
- Better error messages

## Testing the Fix

1. **Open the browser console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. **Look at the backend terminal** to see the role being used
3. **Try resetting a tenant password** from the Tenant Management page
4. **Check the logs** for:
   - Backend: `üîê Reset password request - User role: [role]`
   - Frontend: `üîê Resetting password for tenant: [id]`
   - Success: `‚úÖ Password reset successful, new password received`

## Expected Behavior

1. Click the blue key icon (üîë) for any tenant
2. See the "Reset Tenant Password" dialog
3. Click "Reset Password"
4. See success message and the generated password
5. Copy the password using the "Copy" button
6. Share it securely with the tenant

## Debug Information

If the issue persists, check:
1. **Your user role** in the backend logs when you try to reset
2. **The tenant ID** being sent to the API
3. **Any error messages** in both frontend console and backend terminal
4. **Your authentication token** is valid and not expired

## API Endpoint
```
POST /api/tenant/:tenantId/reset-password
Authorization: Bearer [token]
Response: { tempPassword: string, tenantEmail: string, tenantName: string }
```
