## 🎨 Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - Expenses separated from Financial Reports (view vs. manage)
   - Clear distinction between data entry and analysis

2. **Progressive Enhancement:**

   - Advanced features (filtering, sorting) enhance experience
   - Graceful degradation for older browsers

3. **User-Centric:**
   - Minimal clicks to complete common tasks
   - Smart defaults reduce data entry
   - Clear visual hierarchy

4. **Scalable Architecture:**
   - Modular component structure
   - Reusable API functions
   - Extensible for future features (recurring expenses, budgets, etc.)

- ✅ Role-based authorization (Owner/Manager)
- ✅ Property ownership verification
- ✅ Manager assignment validation
- ✅ SQL injection protection (Prisma ORM)
