## üí∞ Financial Calculations

### **Before (Estimated):**
```typescript
const estimatedExpenses = totalRevenue * 0.3;
const netOperatingIncome = totalRevenue - estimatedExpenses;
```

### **After (Real Data):**
```typescript
const actualExpenses = await prisma.expenses.aggregate({
  where: {
    propertyId: { in: propertyIds },
    status: { in: ['paid', 'pending'] }
  },
  _sum: { amount: true }
});

// Use real data, fall back to estimate if none
const estimatedExpenses = actualExpenses._sum.amount || (totalRevenue * 0.3);
const netOperatingIncome = totalRevenue - estimatedExpenses;
```

### **Impact:**
- More accurate NOI
- Real Cap Rate calculations
- True Operating Margin
- Better financial insights
