# Billing & Plans System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The billing and plans management system is now fully functional with database integration, allowing Super Admins to create, edit, and delete subscription plans, and assign them to customers.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** (Already in place)

  - isActive, isPopular
  - createdAt, updatedAt
- Relation to `Customer` model via `planId`

### 2. **Backend API** (Already in place)
Located in: `backend/src/routes/plans.ts`

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/plans` - Get all plans with customer counts
- `POST /api/plans` - Create new plan
- `PUT /api/plans/:id` - Update existing plan
- `DELETE /api/plans/:id` - Delete plan (prevents deletion if customers are using it)
